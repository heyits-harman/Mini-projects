# ðŸ§  7-Day JavaScript Challenge

This repository contains the projects and practice exercises from my self-driven **7-Day JavaScript Challenge**.

Each day includes:
- A **JavaScript logic challenge** to strengthen problem-solving skills.
- A **mini project** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to apply real-world concepts.

The goal is to build consistency, refine core JS knowledge, and create small, useful apps â€” all while documenting the journey.
